With over 38 years of experience in IP networking, I am deeply passionate about advancing the security and resilience of the global Internet routing infrastructure. As a pioneer in the commercialization of the Internet, I contributed to the launch of SprintLink in 1992—the first commercial IP service by a carrier—and have since architected and consulted on major networks for telecommunications giants like MCI, AT&T, Global-One, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) International Connections Manager (ICM) network connecting over 100 countries. My work has also extended to the U.S. Department of Defense, where I held a Top Secret/SCI clearance and led initiatives for DISA, the Navy, Marine Corps, and other agencies, including the design of secure WAN architectures and contributions to the DISN Overarching Technical Strategy.

For nearly four decades I’ve built, operated, and defended large IP networks across carriers and public-sector environments. I witnessed one of the Internet’s early route hijacks in 1992 and have been committed ever since to making routing security a default, operator-friendly reality. MANRS succeeds when it turns hard-won operational lessons into widely adopted practice—and I want to help accelerate that work through strategic technology planning and creative, out-of-the-box thinking.

I want to join the MANRS Steering Committee to actively contribute to its mission of promoting Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security, particularly through the widespread adoption of RPKI and other best practices to mitigate threats like route hijacking. My extensive service provider background, both domestic and international, combined with my deep involvement in U.S. government networking, positions me to bridge gaps between commercial and public sectors. I believe this perspective can help expand MANRS's reach, including educating and engaging government entities to enhance global RPKI deployment and overall routing hygiene.

As a Steering Committee member, I will focus on outcomes:

Lowering adoption friction for MANRS Actions and RPKI/ROV through reproducible playbooks, mentoring, and pragmatic guidance.
Deepening engagement with public-sector and critical-infrastructure operators worldwide, aligning procurement and compliance language with MANRS so security becomes the easy choice—leveraging executive-level relationship management and vendor negotiations.
Strengthening community accountability, evolving conformance criteria and using data from measurements to reward progress and spotlight what works.
Improving incident learning loops so leaks and hijacks become teachable moments that raise the bar for everyone.

I bring a global service-provider perspective, experience bridging vendors, operators, and government, and a bias for hands-on execution across architecture, engineering, and operations. Most importantly, I share the community-first ethos at the heart of MANRS. I’m running to help make secure routing ubiquitous—a default, operator-friendly norm delivered with discretion and efficiency at scale.
